# Result View App

## Overview
The **Result View App** is built for students who are applying for a special degree and need to manually calculate their subject-wise GPA. Since the university system does not automatically calculate GPA for individual subjects, this app simplifies the process and helps students make informed decisions about their applications.

## Features
- Automatic calculation of subject-wise GPA
- User-friendly interface for quick and accurate results
